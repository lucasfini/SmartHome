# MQ-2 (Semiconductor Sensor for Combustible Gas)

## Table of Contents




## Introduction

<p> The MQ-2 is a Metal Oxide Semiconductor that detects LPG, Smoke, Alcohol,Propane, Hydrogen, Methane and Carbon Monoxide. It does this by looking at change of resistence before and after a gas comes in contact with the material. These concentrations can range anywhere from 200 - 10,000ppm. The sensor is great for a multiple range of gas detection, and can be used in a ton of industrial, and at home areas. This Mq-2 sensor from Willwin is a very low-cost, and very responsive sensor. The operating voltage is 5v with it consuming <800mw of energy. It has very easy wiring, and works perfectly with the stm32 blue pill.<p>
