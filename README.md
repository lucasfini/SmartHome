## <a name="Introduction"> Introduction </a>

<p> The MQ-2 is a Metal Oxide Semiconductor that detects LPG, Smoke, Alcohol,Propane, Hydrogen, Methane and Carbon Monoxide. It does this by looking at change of resistence before and after a gas comes in contact with the material. These concentrations can range anywhere from 200 - 10,000ppm. The sensor is great for a multiple range of gas detection, and can be used in a ton of industrial, and at home areas. This Mq-2 sensor from Willwin is a very low-cost, and very responsive sensor. The operating voltage is 5v with it consuming <800mw of energy. It has very easy wiring, and works perfectly with the stm32 blue pill.<p>

## <a name="B"> Bill of Materials/Budget </a>

The required price for my whole project is about $100. This is the price if you are a student at humber, and have collected the parts kit at the beginning of semester 1. If you do not have the parts kit, you will need to pay an extra $120 dollars for the parts kit. I also used the schools prototype lab to get my case and pcb made. If you would like to go to a external dealer, the price will increase on top of the $220 already spent for the parts and the kit. If you are a student the required materials will be below for you to view.

## <a name="T"> Time Commitment </a>

The first time Commitment I will talk about is the CENG-317 schedule. You will get 14 weeks to complete this hardware assignment. Each week is a new task to do, some will take longer than others. The weeks that most people have difficulties on is week 9 and 11. These weeks are the PCB solder and Enclosure due dates. Since you need external equipment to do these two weeks, it will be more difficult to find the time to do them. Plus, if you design your enclosure or pcb wrong, you will need to keep on trying until you get them right. Note: Try to be ahead for these two weeks, just incase something unexpected happens. 

Now, this is for people that are building this on their free time. If you were to have all the equipment, and just needed to get the pcb and enclosure it should take you about a week, because of the shipping of pcb and enclosure. If you already have a pcb and enclosure you can realistically do this in a weekend. That is only if you have everything with you and are prepared.
