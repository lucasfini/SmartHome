  <p>From using the github page that was supplied by Kristian Medri I was able to fix the errors that were coming up in Arduino 1.8.10. To fix the errors that I was getting you need to download the library down below for the stm32. For Uploading the Blink sketch we have to download the Arduino IDE. Then go to Tools > Boards > Boards Manager, the search the STM32 and install it.<p>
 
 <p> If you need more help with this a good reference that I used is: https://github.com/IshanKhuttan/HumberNavigator <p>

  <p> Soldering the pcb board was due this week. Was not able to complete on time because of issues with my pcb board. Will try to figure out the problem between stm32 and serial connection. I have listed all the links below of all the videos and websites I visted to try and fix the solution. <p>

 <p> I have uploaded two pictures of the breadboarding to show how the FT232Rl and Stm32 blue pill are supposed to work together.  <p>

  <p> UPDATE-Nov 4: Researched multiple ways to try and come up with a fix for this problem, couldn't figure it out. If serial connection is not successful, will have to use ST-Link v2 instead. <p>
 
 <p> Had problems with the STM32. The error is posted below. <p>

 <p> I then tried to fix this by ordering a FTDI which would allow the STM32 bootloader to work. Although that also came with errors.

<p> Finished with the designs for my breadboard, schematic and PCB . Fritzing file is in the electronics Folder. Click on link down below. <p>

  <p> On the sensor, the naming of AO and GND should be switched. I tried to change it in the program but could not figure it out. Since I am using MQ-2 and not MQ-4 the pinouts are a little different.

<p> Today I handed in my proposal. Was not able to complete the whole proposal. Since my group is doing our own project, we are still searching for a collaborator. </p>
