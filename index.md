 <p> Had problems with the STM32. The error is posted below. <p>

 <p> I then tried to fix this by ordering a FTDI which would allow the STM32 bootloader to work. Although that also came with errors.

  <p> On the sensor, the naming of AO and GND should be switched. I tried to change it in the program but could not figure it out. Since I am using MQ-2 and not MQ-4 the pinouts are a little different.
